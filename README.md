Essential Python Demos
===========

Hi, I'm Nicola Iarocci. Welcome to my demos repository for my [Essential Python Training Course][1] from [Global Knowledge][2]. 

If you are in one of my courses *right now*, **start by selecting your course's branch** and then just click 'Download ZIP' or clone this repo to your system. On the other hand, if you took my course awhile ago and want access to the demos, your course has probably been **moved to another branch**. Use the branches dropdown to find it just contact me (email address is listed in my github profile).

If you are **not** in one of our courses, enjoy the samples and please consider Global Knolwedge for your [IT Training][3]!

Cheers

[Michael Kennedy][4] built this course up from scratch. Back in 2012 (I think) he
invited me to join the teachers' team at DevelopMentor (now acquired by Global
Knowledge). It took a while but now, four years later, that seed has finally
grown.

Thank you Michael.
